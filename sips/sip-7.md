## Abstract

This SIP presents improvements to the Deepbook package to enable better composability of `Pool`s, which would enable their use in a wide range of applications.

We describe some changes to the Pool creation process to allow for `ownable` Pools, instead of the current paradigm which always creates a shared Pool object. We also describe some modifications to the return values of some of the methods in `clob_v2` and `custodian_v2` modules for easier deepbook integration.
